# Discord-Scatterplot-GUI

This is a simple GUI for [adryd235's discord scatter plot](https://gist.github.com/adryd325/f811e975bf8240fb6e6555e57c3db7d2) that allows you to create a scatterplot from your discord messages.

## Installation

Either download the .py file and run it with python, or [download the .exe file](https://github.com/TheSaltyGaming/Discord-Scatterplot-GUI/releases) and run it.

## Usage

1. Download your discord data from the discord app and unzip it!
2. Open the app and follow the instructions.
3. After clicking run, you should find the out.PNG/SVG file in the same folder as the .exe file (or .py file if you ran the script yourself).

## How to download your discord data
1. Open discord
2. Click on the settings icon
3. Go to "Privacy & Safety"
4. Scroll down to "Download Your Data"
5. Request your data and wait for the email. This might take a week or two.
6. Download the data and unzip it

## Help, windows defender detects the .exe as a virus!
This is a common issue with pyinstaller which I used to compile the exe file. You can either run the .py file or add an exception to the .exe file. It is completely harmless
